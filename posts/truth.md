I have an obligation as a human being to pursue the truth.

I have an obligation to seek the truth every second of the day.

And not only that, but to share it also.

If and only if I believe I have it.

Otherwise I will stand my ground and hope to god it's in your possession.

If it's not, then we shall search for the truth together. And we ought to have the humbleness to accept that we are yet to possess it.
 

The days today seem like an unwrenched wet towel, soaked in every cavity of its fabric. The abundance of information plunders you of the truth, as it increasingly feels it needs an impossible effort to be discovered. For the water to be wrenched out to know the towel once more.

The truth is absolute. The truth is logic. Just as the physical world operates within a finite number of laws, the truth, the logic, operates within the similar limits.

But we are constantly veering away from the truth as we become less competent at accessing the logic that resides within the beautiful structure, called the mind.

We need to be very weary at fighting endlessly to prove oneself correct over the other. Truth reveals itself seamlessly and it only comes from within. It cannot be forced out but guided out. And not guided out actively, but passively.

Truth hides in darkness when defamed. Truth comes to the light when fostered. The real truth comes when it's safe for it to come out.

Therefore truth is dependent on the environment that we as human beings build for ourselves. If the environment harbors tools that can be used to obscure truth from the pursuer, it always leads to exploitation.

To exploit one is to conceal the truth from one. The concealment of truth becomes easy once you have control over or access to one's mind. You can mend it, condition it, and mould it into what you wish it to be. And technology has made that easier for you and me. The question is, who will be the rotten apple? Because there's always one to spoil the bunch.

Today exploitation runs rampant in the foundations of our environment and that's why we seem to be in eternal conflict. We can't find common ground. We're the left and they're the right, the black and the white, the right and the wrong, but when are we to converge on one path to the light?

There's no progress if there is no agreement. And there is no agreeement to be had if there's no platform for it to sit on. Our environment today is made for partisanship to divide us rather than to be absolute one. But being a single unit is a true representation and the only representation of the truth's absoluteness. And that's the true environment that fosters truth.

The longer it takes for us to find common ground, the longer the exploiter maintains and grows their interests.
