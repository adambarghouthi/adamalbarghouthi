Every problem that you can identify is not the problem you need to solve, because each problem is the result of another one except for the indivisible core problem. So if you don’t kill the source, your efforts have been futile.

Problem solving is about designing a solution for the core problem and not the superficial problem that your intuition points you to. Once you identify the core problem, the solution is essentially the antithesis. So the most important question to ask is, where does this problem come from?  If you truly want to know someone, you need to move past their physical appearance and understand their emotions, their interests, their actions and reactions; essentially their internal being. You can’t necessarily understand their ethos and principles by simply looking at them.

This is to say that the problem is never the problem to solve. Our job is to keep peeling the layers until we can peel no more. And then we design a solution based on the core. The core is the basic unit and it’s indivisible, so the core becomes your guideline for the solution’s design. Designing anything is much easier with guidelines because it gives you directionality.

When you have a fight with someone, you can get caught up in your emotions and act irrationally. After you’ve calmed down, you reflect on the incident and promise yourself that you won’t do that again. That’s the superficial approach. The more optimal approach is to ask where that irrationality comes from. Once you know where it comes from, you’ll realize that the core problem gives birth to other problems too. And you begin to form a better understanding of yourself and therefore a better understanding of what you need to change in yourself.

The nice thing about problems is they’re like trees. We all get lost in the sway of their branches and their luscious green leaves. But when we want to get rid of a tree, we must pull it out from the roots rather than trim its branches. That method gets rid of the tree and its branches as a whole.

If we approach any problem by the same method—weeding it out from the root—we begin to realize that anything is possible.
